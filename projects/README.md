## [Code for Portland](http://codeforportland.org)

Code for Portland is a [Code for America brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/) that I started in March of 2014 with lots of help from [Erica Lauer Vose](http://lauervose.com/), [Nathan Wittstock](http://milkandtang.com/), and [Mele Sax-Barnett](http://pdxmele.com/). We host civic hacking events, work on civic tech projects with municipal partners and non-profits, and advocate for open data.

## [Geobin.io](http://geobin.io)

Geobin is a project I started at work based on an idea from [Aaron Parecki](http://aaronparecki.com/). It allows you to inspect HTTP requests with geographic data in real time. Originally an internal debugging tool for the [Esri Geotrigger Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/features/geotrigger-service/), it grew into an open source project to test the limits of AngularJS, Golang, and WebSockets with some major help from [Ryan Arana](https://github.com/aranasaurus), [Court Fowler](https://github.com/courtf), and [Josh Yaganeh](https://github.com/jyaganeh).

## [gfm.css](http://ngoldman.github.com/gfm.css/)

gfm.css is a set of styles for github flavored markdown. Use it to make HTML rendered from markdown look like a repo's README on Github, or use it as a base for creating your own style (like the one on this site).

## [TinyStore](http://ngoldman.github.io/tinystore/)

TinyStore is a tiny web storage wrapper (> 1k minified). It works with `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, objects, and functions (hat tip to [Jerry Sievert](http://legitimatesounding.com/) for expanding support beyond `localStorage`). I originally wrote it for use with [Geobin](http://geobin.io). My goal was to create the simplest possible API for persisting session information.
