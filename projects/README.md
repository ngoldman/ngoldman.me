## past

### [`Koop`](http://koopjs.github.io/)

Building on the work of [Chris Helm](https://github.com/chelm) and the [Esri DC R&D Center](http://dc.esri.com/) to create a modular [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) engine for dynamically transforming geospatial data on the web. [Pull requests](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette) welcome.

### [`Code for Portland`](http://codeforportland.org)

Code for Portland is a [Code for America brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/) I founded with help from [Erica Lauer Vose](https://twitter.com/elauervose), [Nathan Wittstock](https://twitter.com/milkandtang), and [Mele Sax-Barnett](http://pdxmele.com/) in 2014. We hosted civic hacking events, worked on civic tech projects with municipal partners and non-profits, and advocated for open data. I'm currently looking to hand off management of the group to someone excited about being a local leader in civic technology.

### [`ArcGIS for Developers`](https://developers.arcgis.com)

I worked on the design and development of a documentation site for developers that needed to use Esri's [ArcGIS web platform](http://www.arcgis.com/features/), along with [Paul C Pederson](http://ppaulcpederson.com), [Nikolas Wise](http://nikolas.io/), [Rachel Nehmer](https://github.com/kneemer), [Manny Lopez](https://twitter.com/himannylopez), and our fearless leader [Patrick Arlt](https://github.com/patrickarlt/).

### [`geobin.io`](http://geobin.io)

A web application that allows you to inspect HTTP requests with geographic data. Built at the [Esri Portland R&D Center](http://pdx.esri.com) with [Ryan Arana](https://github.com/aranasaurus), [Josh Yaganeh](https://github.com/jyaganeh), and [Court Fowler](https://github.com/courtf).

### [`Geotrigger Service`](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/features/geotrigger-service/)

A web platform and set of SDKs for adding [geofencing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence) capabilities to mobile applications. I helped build supporting software for it like the [Geotrigger Editor](https://developers.arcgis.com/geotrigger-service/guide/geotrigger-editor/) and [Geotrigger Faker](https://developers.arcgis.com/geotrigger-service/guide/geotrigger-faker/).
