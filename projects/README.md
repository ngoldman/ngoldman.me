## Orgs

### [`Esri PDX`](http://pdx.esri.com)

A small team of geniuses brought together by [Amber Case](http://caseorganic.com/) and [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/) working on web and mobile geospatial tools. I work there as a web developer and designer. My secret agenda is to bring [Open Web](http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2008/04/whats-open-web-and-why-is-it-important.html) values and processes to the monolithic mapping software corporation that we serve.

### [`Code for Portland`](http://codeforportland.org)

A [Code for America brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/) I started with help from [Erica Lauer Vose](https://twitter.com/elauervose), [Nathan Wittstock](https://twitter.com/milkandtang), and [Mele Sax-Barnett](http://pdxmele.com/) in 2014. We host civic hacking events, work on civic tech projects with municipal partners and non-profits, and advocate for open data. Currently we're focusing on [housing](https://github.com/CodeForPortland/housing).

## Services

### [`geobin.io`](http://geobin.io)

A web application that allows you to inspect HTTP requests with geographic data. Built at the [Esri Portland R&D Center](http://pdx.esri.com) with [Ryan Arana](https://github.com/aranasaurus), [Josh Yaganeh](https://github.com/jyaganeh), and [Court Fowler](https://github.com/courtf).

## Software

### [`Geotrigger Service`](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/features/geotrigger-service/)

A web platform and set of SDKs for adding [geofencing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence) capabilities to mobile applications. I helped build supporting software for it like the [Geotrigger Editor](https://developers.arcgis.com/geotrigger-service/guide/geotrigger-editor/) and [Geotrigger Faker](https://developers.arcgis.com/geotrigger-service/guide/geotrigger-faker/).

### [`Koop`](http://github.com/esri/koop)

Working with [Chris Helm](https://github.com/chelm) and the [Esri DC R&D Center](http://dc.esri.com/) to create a modular [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) engine for viewing and downloading open spatial data from different providers and formats. [Pull requests](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette) welcome.

### [`gh-release`](http://github.com/ngoldman/gh-release/)

A command-line utility for creating a [release](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) for a node package on github that I've been working on with [Bret Comnes](http://bret.io/about/) and [Paul C Pederson](http://paulcpederson.com/). Part of a larger effort to create [versioneer](https://github.com/ngoldman/versioneer/issues/1).

### [`jekyll-reveal`](http://ngoldman.github.io/jekyll-reveal/)

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) template for quickly writing slides in markdown. Based on [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo)'s [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) Jekyll theme and [Hakim El Hattab](https://github.com/hakimel)'s [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) HTML presentation framework.

### [`TinyStore`](http://ngoldman.github.io/tinystore/)

A javascript [web storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage) library geared towards easily setting and getting objects in [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

### [`style.css`](http://ngoldman.github.com/style.css/)

An attempt at creating a set of independent and complementary style modules. So far, includes [gfm.css](http://ngoldman.github.com/gfm.css/) and [top-bar.css](http://ngoldman.github.com/top-bar.css/).

## Articles

Sometimes I write things, mostly about the internet and open source software.

## Advice?

I'm also inexplainably an advisor for some great organizations and projects.
